Week 1

I usually start my  designing after I have main structure in my mind. However after I started I can’t help diverted  from  my original designing and sometimes totally forget what I want to design and massed up with some unrelated and unplanned staffs.   It  wastes my time a lot. Once I pleaded myself that I will never go beyond a step from my plan  whatever the new idea  looks great.  But the temptation of “to be perfect” mindset always harassed me in my designing. Looks my design never meet my imagination.  This feeling sometimes push me work on a small staffs hour and hour , even day and day…But the very ironic  is  I feel I the first deciding is the better in finally  after I spend a lot of effort. How can I get rid of this inefficient and wasteful  designing  behaviour ?

Hi,
I've a couple of questions;
First question for today is about best practice for positioning elements,
One way is to use top x, left x combined with position absolute and position relative (parent container). The use of transform: translate(x, x) could be used to fine tune the position when centering is needed.
Another way is to work with padding/margin.
Which of these approaches is more used and how does that translate to responsive design?
Second question, is it worth the time to structure my css with BEM even tho it takes more time to write code or should I use it in a later phase?
Final question, I'm exploring the use of SCSS and to my knowledge thats the route I want to take to optimise my workflow. Should I dig deeper into css fundamentals before switching to SCSS or should I already implement it in my projects?

Well I'd add some question about CLI and HTML5 CSS/SASS/LESS
1- Command line interface is an huge part in programing and there are some developers did not use GUI graphical user interface at all !
Do we need to work and learn everything in CLI or that is optional and just the basic things that will be done easily with it.
2- About Sass / Less
we all know how many languages you learn how sooner to get job and to build solid career, But do we need them in our program at some point?
3- In Html there is closing tags and open tags why?  <br> tag I know that  wrap nothing around but even though it use space in the layout and we can not select BR tag in CSS to increase this space for instance, We need to write 3* <br> to do that ... why?

My questions are: In the 3th videos in the min 12, Arco said when he compared between Front-End and Back-End that we use JavaScript in both of them. does JS have the same logic and mechanism in both of them or it interacts differently in each one of them?  Second one: talking about browsers, can you tell as which browser is better for us to use? because learning some CSS features I saw that Edge now supports features which are not supported in Chrome, like Mask.  the third one: why we don't dedicate the first module to learn advanced features in HTML and CSS like: sass, variables, nesting, @mixin and parameters ...etc. Because being accepted in HYF supposes that we already know the basics.

Hi,
Hi have two question to ask .
when i used Codepen in my initial assignment I had the live preview in the side window that was more easy to design. Is it also possible in VS to use the Live preview in the side window.
In Position absolute and Relative , margins & padding I am always confused when to use which of these.


1. BEM only be used when your css code is written in SCSS style. 
2. There is REM EM and PX
